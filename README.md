TODO
- Run ROCs on continuous data.
- Make sure we believe ROCs for discrete data.
- Add tests for new functions:
- clean up data directory
- Send David results, ask him to find data
- Write up KCI in paper, edit previous stuff
- Look at previous work using kernels to learn BNs
- Devise scoring function for KCI
- Look into conditioning on many nodes.
- Generalize distp
- Test all kernels in test_kci
- Download proper dataset (Karen Sachs? yeast?)
- Compare BIC scores with output of bscore.
