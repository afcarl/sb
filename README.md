TODO
- Run ROCs on continuous data.
- Write up KCI in paper, edit previous stuff
- Look at previous work using kernels to learn BNs
- Devise scoring function for KCI
- Look into conditioning on many nodes.
- Generalize distp
- Download proper dataset (Karen Sachs? yeast?)
- Take out unnecessary multiplications by H in kci_classifier, since H is idempotent, hence Tr(HAH HBH) = Tr(AHBH).
