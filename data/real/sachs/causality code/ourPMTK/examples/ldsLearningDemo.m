%% Sample from 'Ground Truth'
setSeed(0);
nTimeSteps = 100;
[Z,Y] = sample(groundTruth,nTimeSteps);
%% Learn Back the Dynamics
testModel = LinearDynamicalSystemDist('stateSize',stateSize); % at a minimum, we must specify the dimensionality of the hidden states.
testModel = fit(testModel,Y,'verbose',true);

% Initializing the params to sensible values is crucial. Here we simply use
% random values, (bad idea!) Lack of identifiability means the learned
% params are often far from the true ones. All that EM guarantees is that 
% the likelihood will increase. The current values of the model, if any,
% are used to initialize EM. You can specify these, prior to fitting, just
% like we did for the 'Ground Truth' model above.
