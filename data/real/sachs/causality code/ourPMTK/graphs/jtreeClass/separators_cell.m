function [sepsize, seps]=separators_cell(cliques, jtree)
% NOTE: if you just want a 1 x num_seps array of the sequence separators, use
%       seps_residuals_histories.m
% inputs: 1. cliques, a 1 x t cell array of the t nonempty cliques of g in
%           RIP ordering (from chordal_to_ripcliques_cell.m)
%         2. jtree, the associated t x t adjacency matrix of the junction tree
% output: 1. sepsize, a matrix array of the size of the separator sets, in which
%           sepsize(i,j) = [number of elements in intersection between
%           cliques cliques{i} and cliques{j} if they are adjacent, and zero else.
%         2. seps, a (num_cliques)x(num_cliques) cell array
%           in which seps{i,j}=cliques{i} intersect cliques{j}.
