function complete_subgraphs = maximalCliques( X )
%MAXIMALCLIQUES finds all the maximal complete sub-graphs in a graph
%   The graph passed must be an upper rectangular square matrix. Each row
%   of a matrix denotes the presence of an edge with 1, and an absence of
%   it with 0. The row and col no. of an edge denotes the connecting nodes.
%   Given this matrix, this function finds all the maximal complete 
%   sub-graph (a set of nodes amongst all the nodes which form a complete 
%   sub-graph i.e. every node connects to every other) also known as 
%   cliques. A maximal graph is returned since every complete sub-graph 
%   will also have smaller complete sub-graphs inside itself. NOTE: this 
%   function would not return single node sub-graphs, although every
%   isolated node, in concept, also forms a complete sub-graph
%   The function returns all the sub-graphs in a cell-array, where each
%   row denotes a new sub-graph
